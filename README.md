# KerrGeodesicSolver
Using analytical method mentioned in arXiv:1906.05090: "Analytic solutions for parallel transport along generic bound geodesics in Kerr spacetime" to do Kerr Geodesics' numerical simulations
# Some Discription
Currently it can just solve for geodesic with input:
- r1 & r2: Perihelion & Aphelion
- a: spin parameter
- z1: $z_1=\cos(\theta_{max})$ where $\theta_{max}$ is the maximun theta angle in BL coordinate particle can get in Kerr spacetime
- delta_lambda & N: step size and max steps in Mino time
